# Project TREADS - [Repo](https://github.com/YeluriKetan/project-TREADS)

> **TREADS** stands for **T**ry, **R**ealize and **E**xplore **A**lgorithms and **D**ata **S**tructures

## What do I do here?

> I like solving problems, irrespective of the nature and extent of the problem. As a Computer Science undergraduate student, I was introduced to programming problems in a course [module](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2040S/data-structures-and-algorithms). And ever since, solving problems with code while listening to lofi music has been my go-to productive pastime.
