## About

> Built as an individual project for CS2103T - Software Engineering taken in AY2021-2022 Semester 1, **POSEIDON** (Poseidon) is a **desktop application for keeping track of todo tasks, upcoming deadlines and planning events**. Poseidon's efficient and intelligent algorithm, combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) and a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) gives you a fast and smooth user experience. If you can type fast, Poseidon can help you plan and organize your day faster than traditional GUI apps.
