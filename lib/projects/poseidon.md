## What's Poseidon?

> Poseidon is a **desktop application for keeping track of todo tasks, upcoming deadlines and planning events**. Poseidon's efficient and intelligent algorithm, combined with an **optimized Command Line Interface (CLI)** and a **simple Graphical User Interface (GUI)** gives you a fast and smooth user experience. If you can type fast, Poseidon can help you plan and organize your day faster than traditional GUI apps.

> Poseidon was built as a **[green-field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project#Software_development) individual software project** as part of [CS2103T - Software Engineering](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2103T/software-engineering), a course/module taken in Year 2 Semester 1 of my undergraduate studies.
