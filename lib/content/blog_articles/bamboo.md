# Project Bamboo

I was fortunate enough to embark on an **Overseas Community Involvement Project** (OCIP) to [Bamboo School](https://bambooschoolthailand.com/), Kanchanaburi in Thailand during Dec 2022.

## A beautiful experience...

## Lasting memories

## What I learnt...

My biggest learning from planning this OCIP has to be sheer importance of attention to detail. I have seen the necessity of **care and considerations** that need to be kept in mind regarding the stakeholders, the logistics, the timeline, and last but certainly not the least the impact of our actions. As my first time being involved in planning a project of this scale and impace, I for the most part played a passive role, observing, learning, and contributing when called upon.

If I were to do this again, I would jump at the opportunity to take initiative and tackle challenges head on. One thing I learnt from this experience that I would like to try and apply to the rest of my life is **finding purpose** and meaning behind the endeavours I take upon and being mindful of them when striving to succeed in them.
