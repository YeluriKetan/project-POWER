> **gitGud** is a [slang rendering](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/git-gud/) of **get good**, and refers to getting better at a task or skill, used especially among video gamers online.

## What is it?

> gitGud is a GUI-based desktop application for storing and managing your friends’ gaming information and schedules. It is built for gamers and provides a gamer-themed experience with a focus on increasing the efficiency through its typing-based interface.

> This product is the result of a **[brown-field](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)>) software team project** that was done as part of [CS2103T - Software Engineering](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2103T/software-engineering), a course/module that I took in Year 2 Semester 1 of my undergraduate studies.

## What did I do?

> Since there was quite an extensive codebase when we started on the project, there was a lot of refactoring to be done considering that we wanted to morph the product (rather than evolve, the two options we were given). I took on the role and responsibility of refactoring and maintaining the **Model** part of the application, described in the [Developer guide](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#34-model-component) as:

> > _a runtime model of the data using Java objects that represent real-world entities and associations that simulate relationships between these entities._

> I was incharge of implementing any and all functionality required from the **Model**, as well as writing [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) to ensure bug-free behavior. Since the team designed the product collectively, I got to **design, implement and document** a completely new feature. I won't bother you with the exact details of the feature, but it enables the user to get information of a specific friend or game using their respective commands. There's a dedicated [page](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/team/yeluriketan.html) if you want a more in-depth technical view of my contributions to the project. You can also check out the [slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEvNiNe-Ys/caCuKNOUm2le407vYL-AeA/view?utm_content=DAEvNiNe-Ys&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) we made for the **Product pitch** presentation.

## Did I learn anything?

> This was my first experience working on a software project in a team setting. Naturally it came with its own challenges like communication, creative conflicts, deadlines and different working styles. I learnt how to and how not to deal with these challenges, and the importance of respecting others' time. I also learnt technical stuff like - **the different types of [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle), design, requirements, modelling, testing, documentation, project management, and common SE tools/practices**.

## Numbers for perspective

- Contributed over **3.8k lines** of functional, test and documentation code
- Achieved over **98%** coverage on the assigned section of the codebase
- Deployed the fully functional, submission-ready version in **12 weeks** since the start of the project
