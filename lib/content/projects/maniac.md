# Project MANIAC - [Repo](https://github.com/YeluriKetan/project-MANIAC)

> **MANIAC** stands for **M**y **A**ttempt of the **N**aturally **I**nteresting **A**dvent of **C**ode

## What's all the mania about?

> As described by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code),

> > _[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar)._

> Basically, Advent of Code is like a triathlon; except that instead of athletic events, its programming puzzles of varying skills and difficulty while being Christmas themed (what a fun combo, right?). Since it consists of 25 challenges instead of 3, I guess it's more appropriate to call it a **Programming Icosikaipentathlon** (yes, that's a [real word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_polygons)).

## What's in it for me?

> I heard about Advent of Code for the first time in [December of '20](https://adventofcode.com/2020), but I did not think much of it owing to the fact that it had been only 4 months since I wrote my first piece of code. When people started gearing up for the ['21 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2021), I had a bit of [experience](/projects/treads) by then. I wanted to give it a proper shot this time, and [NUS Hackers](https://www.nushackers.org/) came in with a private leaderboard (I do fancy myself a good competition).

## So how was it?

> It was a fun experience, so much so that on the 6th day of the event, I started attempting the '20 edition simultaneously. In this way, I spent most of that winter vacation trying to solve new, creative and interesting puzzles as fast as I could. By the end of the 25 days event, I had successfully completed 50 days worth of puzzles, learnt a bunch of new stuff and most importantly enjoyed it throughout.

> I managed to miss the entirety of '22 edition due to exams and an [overseas trip](/blog/bamboo), but I eventually got around to doing it along with '23 edition. Can't wait for the next december - Winter is always coming!!!
